              <div class="comment"><strong>Lance 💓:</strong> My experience at FEU Marikina Roosevelt has been both exciting and meaningful. From the first day, I felt the warm and welcoming atmosphere of the campus. On that first day of school, I met two amazing friends, and that made me feel really good because I knew I had found great people to be with. As days passed, I met even more wonderful friends who made my FEU Marikina Roosevelt experience even better. <br> <br> The lessons and activities helped me grow not only academically but also personally. I’ve learned the value of teamwork, discipline, and being responsible. FEU Marikina Roosevelt truly feels like a second home a place where I’m inspired to learn, improve, and dream bigger every day.❤️</div>
              <div class="comment"><strong>Lui 💓:</strong> My experience at Far Eastern University Roosevelt has been truly eye opening. I realized that learning here goes beyond books and classrooms it’s about discovery, teamwork, and personal growth. The environment encourages me to learn new things while enjoying every activity we do. Whether it’s group projects, events, or simple classroom discussions, I’ve found that education can be both meaningful and fun. FEU Roosevelt has taught me that learning becomes more exciting when you’re surrounded by supportive classmates and teachers who inspire you to do your best every day.</div>
              <div class="comment"><strong>Ann 💓:</strong> Being a student here in FEUR is a whole new experience for me. Everything is new: the environment, the people, and the teachers. This was the first time in a long time that I went to a new chapter of my life alone. Going into BSIT without any background in computers, coding, and the languages was definitely challenging for me. Despite the hardships and challenges, it made me feel alive. The knowledge and wisdom being imparted to me really helped me grow, not just academically speaking but also as a person. I admit that I’m still afraid of making mistakes; there’s still that lingering feeling of wanting to perfect everything. But the FEUR community helped me realize that mistakes are part of the learning process, and without them, how else am I going to learn? <br><br> Bit by bit, I am slowly gaining more confidence with my own strength, and I can’t wait to improve myself more.</div>
              <div class="comment"><strong>Claire 💓:</strong> Being part of FEU Roosevelt Marikina has opened a whole new chapter in my life. The surroundings, the classmates, and the professors all feel unfamiliar yet exciting.  Entering BSIT without any knowledge of computers, coding, or programming languages was intimidating, but it’s also fun to discover new things. <br> <br>The challenges may not be easy, but each lesson has helped me grow not only as a student but also as a person.  I’m learning to trust my own abilities, to embrace the process, and to look forward to the person I’m becoming, especially now with FEU Roosevelt Marikina teaching me a lot of new stuff. This journey is just beginning, and I’m eager to see how far I can go.</div>
              <div class="comment"><strong>Thomas 💓:</strong> As a proud Tamaraw, I’m excited to be part of FEU’s vibrant community that values innovation, excellence, and growth. The university provides endless opportunities to learn. From its modern facilities and engaging programs to its inspiring professors who guide us to become future-ready professionals.</div>
